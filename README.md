# iris-flower-species-classification
This project develops a machine learning model to classify iris flower species using the Iris dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. PCA is also used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of results
